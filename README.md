# Sapphire-pro-enclosure
An enclosure for the Sapphire Pro 3D printer, made of 2.5mm acrylic sheets and 3D printed parts.
It will help you improve print quality for difficult materials. It should also greatly reduce power consumption and noise level.
Much more stylish than Two Trees default one, and with a top cover which actually makes it useful.
